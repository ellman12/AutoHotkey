# AutoHotkey

All of my AutoHotkey and iCUE stuff.

AutoHotkey has completely changed my workflow and way of going about doing tasks on a computer. In addition to making my work easier, it has also helped me to self-learn and practice many important programming conventions and skills, such as DRY (don't repeat yourself), KISS (keep it simple, stupid), planning before programming, and how to use git and GitHub professionally and smartly. Amazing language.
