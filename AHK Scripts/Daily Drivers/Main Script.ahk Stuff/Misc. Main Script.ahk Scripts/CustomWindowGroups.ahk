;This script was created on Wednesday, September 16, 2020.
;I realized that, if I combined my 2 window groups and 2 window hiders, I could have a lot more power.
;There is also the ability to toggle what the single key does. It either switches between them, or hides them.
;There is a way to do this for all of them, regardless of what mode you're in.
;By default when the script starts, F6 and F7 are the 2 window groups, and F8 and F10 are the 2 window hiders.
;This can be changed in the Main Control Panel.
